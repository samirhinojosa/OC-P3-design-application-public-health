## **Problem to solve**

You are **Data Scientist** in an **EdTech start-up**, called **Academy**, which offers online training content for high school and university level audiences.

Mark, your manager, has invited you to a meeting to introduce you to the company's international expansion plan. 

He gives you a first mission of exploratory analysis, to determine if the data on education of **the World Bank** allow to inform the expansion plan.

Here are the different **questions** Mark would like to explore, which you noted during the meeting:

1. Which countries have a strong potential of customers for our services?
2. For each of these countries, how will this potential customer develop?
3. In which countries should the company operate as a priority?
